# Related List

A simple component that is used in Experience Cloud to display a list of related records.

This LWC gives you the ability to specify specific fields to display on a related list.

This gives you more flexibility than the standard OOTB related list component in communities.

## âœ¨Features

### Specify your own fields and avoid page layouts

- Depending on the object, some page layouts require specific fields to be present. You can now specify your own fields to be displayed.

### Custom Section Label

- You have the ability to specify the label that will display for the section

### Section Icon

- You have the ability to choose an SLDS to display for the section

### Columns

- You have the ability to choose between 1 and 5 columns

### Custom Column Labels

- You have the ability to specify the label you want to display on a column

## Future Improvements

- Move the columns to custom metadata so we can have more configurations in place (how to display the field -- link, phone, email, etc...)
- Ability to filter on the related records
